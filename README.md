# skeletonfullnav
A small addition to a sample skeleton css project to include a full width and responsive navbar

The majority of the code is pulled from the [Skeleton CSS Website](http://getskeleton.com/) and expands on the navbar found on the main page.

JQuery 3.1.2 is included in this code for simplicities sake. No additional steps are required, and the page will load from clone.
